Hi there, I'm Jordan. 

I'm a technology enthusiast working full time as a Site Reliability Engineer and moonlighting as a technology blogger and freelance cross-platform developer. I graduated from the University of Michigan and have amassed over 5 years of professional IT experience across a variety of roles ranging from Technical Consultant to Software Developer. 

My specific area of expertise revolves around Microsoft Azure development with .NET, but I actively work on projects involving Application Performance Monitoring and infrastructure automation, as well as a ton of other interesting topics.

### How we got here
Developing my personal website has been a project that I've been working on for a while. At first, I built out a few Wordpress sites using cheap web hosting providers, but found them to be slow and unresponsive. Not to mention, while Wordpress excels in terms of ease-of-deployment, I found it a pain to build something both minimal and functional.

Thus, I utilized my professional knowledge of the Microsoft Azure world and created my own website from scratch, deploying it via an Azure Web App. This ended up just being too expensive for my purposes, and I've been searching for a better fit for a while now.

GitHub Pages has allowed me to deploy a working minimal blog-style website for free, utilizing Markdown for content rather than fiddling with HTML. Ironically, my initial plan for my website was to build an API that allowed my to display Markdown in a blog style, so the project structure of a Jekyll-themed GitHub Pages site is almost exactly what I had envisioned. 

### Why Should you Stick Around?
I post frequent high-quality blog posts based around software development, specifically within the Microsoft space. Rest assured that if I run into an issue in production, there will be a blog about it. Not to mention projects that I'm working on, lessons I've learned, and reviews of the latest consumer tech. 

I also occasionally host a podcast where I talk about IT Careers, drawing from my own experience and that of my network. 

If you enjoy technology, there's probably something here for you!
